Just drop all of these files directly in the data folder.
You can open the data folder by clicking "Open data folder" in the game or browsing to AppData\LocalLow\MonAmiral\HorseRace.

Notice how the TWRK_Winner.png file name has some extra stuff in its name?
That's what's causing the twerking yellow to not appear in-game!!
Remove the extra stuff from the file name to re-enable the TWRK lad.
Note that he's fucking huge, racers are best when in 128x128 pixels!
